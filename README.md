Description:

ColorTap is a simple web application that allows users to dynamically change the background color of a display area based on their selection from a list of colors. The application is built using HTML, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript, providing an interactive and visually appealing user interface. This project showcases how to use JavaScript to manipulate DOM elements and update the style properties in response to user interactions.

Features:

A responsive and clean user interface designed with Tailwind CSS.
A list of selectable colors with a corresponding background color and text color.
Real-time background color change of the main display area when a color is selected from the list.
Modular and maintainable JavaScript code that handles the DOM manipulation and event listeners.

How It Works:

The user is presented with a sidebar containing a list of colors.
Each color in the list is clickable. When a user clicks on a color, the background color of the main content area on the right changes to the selected color.
The project utilizes Tailwind CSS for styling and JavaScript for dynamic content manipulation.
